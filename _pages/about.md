TLDR: Grab my [CV](https://saqeeb.com/files/SaqeebCV.pdf) for a condensed look at my skills and experience.

Hi! I'm a recent MSc graduate from the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto. I was supervised by [Dr. Graham Wright](https://sunnybrook.ca/research/team/member.asp?t=13&m=184&page=172) at the Sunnybrook Research Institue, and I'm working there now as a researcher.

My goal is to **launch a career in the tech industry** using my experience with medical image processing. I specialize in cardiac magnetic resonance image reconstruction with a focus on non-Cartesian data. My areas of interest are: *1)* Pulse sequence development and reconstruction for faster scanning of ventricular tachycardia patients and *2)* MRI Image processing to create cardiac scar maps and identify catheter ablation targets.

We all how powerful machine learning can be for image processing, and I'm currently working on my deep learning skills in order to be a better image processing scientist. I started by doing Dr. Andrew Ng's machine learning course on Coursera to get a handle on the fundamentals. Now I'm going through the neural network projects over on [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) to learn PyTorch while also doing [deeplearning.ai](http://deeplearning.ai)'s deep learning specialization for some TensorFlow experience. Beyond that, I'm making improvements on lung segmentation and heart segmentation models used by my lab for some experience with a real-world dataset.

I'm also an active member of the graduate student community here at UofT, where I served as the Social Committee President for my department.

Previously, I received a BSc in Physics from Queen's University. My undergraduate thesis here looked at why some disk galaxies like [UGC 3697](https://public.nrao.edu/gallery/warped-disk-of-galaxy-ugc-3697-2/) are warped by modeling a galaxy as a series of concentric rings that pull on each other gravitationally.
