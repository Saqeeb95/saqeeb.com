  TLDR: Grab my <a href="https://saqeeb.com/files/SaqeebCV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> for a 
  condensed look at my skills and experience.

  Hi! I'm a recent MSc graduate from the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto. 
  I was supervised by 
  <a href="https://sunnybrook.ca/research/team/member.asp?t=13&m=184&page=172" target="_blank">Dr. Graham Wright</a>
   at the Sunnybrook Research Institue, and I'm working there now as a researcher.
  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My goal is to <b>launch a career in the tech industry</b> using my experience with medical image processing. 
    I specialize in cardiac magnetic resonance image reconstruction with a focus on non-Cartesian data. My areas of interest are:
     <em>1)</em> Pulse sequence development and reconstruction for faster scanning of ventricular tachycardia patients and 
     <em>2)</em> MRI Image processing to create cardiac scar maps and identify catheter ablation targets.
  </p>

    We all know how powerful machine learning can be for image processing, and I'm currently working on my <b>deep learning</b> skills 
    in order to be a better image processing scientist. I started by doing Dr. Andrew Ng's machine learning course on Coursera 
    to get a handle on the fundamentals. Now I'm going through the neural network projects over on
     <a href="https://fast.ai" target="_blank">fast.ai</a> to learn <b>PyTorch</b> while also doing 
     <a href="https://deeplearning.ai" target="_blank">deeplearning.ai</a>'s deep learning specialization for some 
     <b>TensorFlow</b> experience. Beyond that, I'm building a lung segmentation model and making improvements on a 
     heart segmentation model for my lab.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I'm also an active member of the graduate student community here at UofT, where I served as the Social Committee President for
   my department.

  Previously, I received a BSc in Physics from Queen's University. My undergraduate thesis there looked at why 
  some disk galaxies like
   <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/gallery/warped-disk-of-galaxy-ugc-3697-2/" target="_blank">UGC 3697</a> 
   are warped by modeling a galaxy as a series of concentric rings that pull on each other gravitationally.
