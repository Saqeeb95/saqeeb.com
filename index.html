			<h1>Hello Friends!</h1>

			<p>
			How lovely to see that you're still checking up on my website. I'm still learning but hopefully this page will get more and more dope with time. In fact I think I'll make it something completely different every once in a while.
			</p>

			<h2> <i>Look at This Header</i> </h2>

			<p class="faded">
			I made it a whole different colour. Isn't that neat? I think this text is a different colour, too ( The possibilities are endless :O ).
			</p>

			<h2>I Still Have a Lot to Learn</h2>

			<p>
			But I can rely on the wisdom of the wise:
