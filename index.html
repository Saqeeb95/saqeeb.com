			<h1>Hello Friends!</h1>

			<p align="justify" >
			
			Let me tell you a bit about myself. I was born deep underwater in the middle of the specific ocean. When I was a young boy I was bitten by a radioactive volcano, and now I can shoot lava from my left hand (though I've never tried it). My father never hugs me.

			<h2> <i>Look at This Header</i> </h2>

			<p class="faded" align="justify">
			I made it a whole different colour. I think this text is a different colour, too.

			<h2>I Still Have a Lot to Learn</h2>
