			<h1>Hello Friends!</h1>

			<p align="justify" >
			How lovely to see that you're still checking up on my website. I'm a total beginner but hopefully this page will get more and more dope with time. In fact, I think I'll make it something completely different every once in a while.
			<br>
			<br>
			Let me tell you a bit about myself. I was born deep underwater in the middle of the specific ocean. When I was a young boy I was bitten by a radioactive volcano, and now I have can shoot lava from my left hand (I've never tried it though). My father never hugs me.
			</p>

			<h2> <i>Look at This Header</i> </h2>

			<p class="faded" align="justify">
			I made it a whole different colour. Isn't that neat? I think this text is a different colour, too ( The possibilities are endless :O ).
			</p>

			<h2>I Still Have a Lot to Learn</h2>

			<p>
			But I can rely on the wisdom of the wise:

			<blockquote class=fadedquote>
				<i>"Always believe everything you see on the internet"</i>
				<blockquote>- Mahatma Gandhi, probably</blockquote>

				<i>"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"</i>
				<blockquote>

					<blockquote>

							- Michael Scott
						</a>
					</blockquote>
				</blockquote>
